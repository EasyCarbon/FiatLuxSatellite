## Use Cases
- Immediate disaster relief & prevention üî•
- Tracking the efficacy of carbon credit providers üå≥
- Carbon offset tokens with built-in credit quality assurance üõ∞

## Technical Overview

### For Storage (of the satellite imagery & other NFT data):
- We use IPFS & IPNS [^1] for storage (decentralized storage) & Pinata [^2] for updating the folders (CIDs) of the NFT metadata (embedded information) & satellite imagery stored.

### For the Smart Contracts:
- Our NFT smart contracts use the ERC-721A protocol [^3], which allows for low-cost (gas-fee) bulk minting.
- We also use the ERC-1155: Multi Token Standard, as it makes it simpler to create several different collections under one smart contract by allowing the minting of different tokens with unique BaseURIs‚Äîmetadata). [^4]
- We have deployed several pre-audited ERC-1155 templates from Dedaub contract library. [^5]

### For the UI:
- Our public mint page is built with React using Chakra-UI. [^6]

## About Harberger Tax
- We have successfully deployed a Harberger Tax Implementation on Avalanche. (Modeled after WildCards [^7])
- Originally deployed on Goerli Ethereum Test Network [^8], we deployed our version on FUJI.
- Used for ‚Äútaxing‚Äù NFT holders; holders have to pay to keep holding an NFT. [^9]
- *This allowed us to implement a subscription-based NFT.*
